# Prototypes

This folder contains work that is still in the research phase and not ready for production. Eventually the individual packages are meant to scale to production directly as different modules/libraries

This is an ongoing project, and is being maintained to specifically work with thermal videos. The project should be considered more of a starting point for building quick prototypes. Most of the scripts & processes are quite general and can be adapted for many similar projects/data-types (notable examples are to quickyl train rgb dataset with medical objects like syringe, stethescope etc, thermal videos to train the model to detect activities of a person walking, sitting, sleeping etc)

## Modules:
